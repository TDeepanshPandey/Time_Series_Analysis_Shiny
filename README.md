# Time Series Analysis - Shiny (R)

During the project, I have used ARIMA model to predict the number of clones in the next version of a software system. This can help the managers to prepare for the workload in the upcoming months. It also calculate the months and cost using dummy formulas. 

**Accuracy of the model = 3.81%**
